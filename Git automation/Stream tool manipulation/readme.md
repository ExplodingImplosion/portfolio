To support a multi-PC setup for my university's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate tournament streams, I've created a simple GitHub repo that both our stream and management PC are connected to.

# The situation:
The stream PC is responsible for capturing the game and streaming it to Twitch. It has OBS opened, and Ultimate Stream Tool (https://github.com/pokerobybeto/Ultimate-Stream-Tool) installed. Ultimate Stream Tool is one of many applications that makes it easy to create an overlay for tournament streams. It displays players' characters with an icon, the current score, and even their pronouns! All a handy interface for making quick changes to the information displayed.

## However...
This stream PC is located in a dedicated stream room, along with the Nintendo Switch setup that players use specifically for being on-stream. While this has added gameplay benefits of ensuring that players on stream aren't distracted by passerby or other members of the tournament, tournament staff don't really have much of a reason to be in the room along with them. Updating player names and score cards happens infrequently, and even a 20 second trip from the main tournament area into the stream room is more of a hassle than we'd like. The problem with this, is Ultimate Stream Tool, unlike other tools, can't be remotely updated from other PC's. That being said, other tools have complex user interfaces, and while they may come with fancy features, such as an integration with the web client we use to track the status of the tournament, these features have broken from time to time at other tournaments. Having been burned before, I decided that Ultimate Stream Tool was the best choice. That still left me with a conundrum... How do I update the stream from outside the room?

## The solution:
  Do a hack with GitHub. Having recently automated the saving of my brother's Minecraft server, this seemed like the logical choice. This is because Ultimate Stream Tool uses a .json file to check for what to update the scoreboard with. The exe is just a fancy UI to udpate a json. Awesome! So, on both PC's, I've downloaded the stream tool, and put a Git repo within the app's folders. When the tournament runs, I run pull.bat on the stream PC, and push on the management laptop. Now staff can make remote updates to the stream, and reflect our changes on the stream PC within 10 seconds of making them. It would've been simpler to create a fork of Ultimate Stream Tool, and to add the pull and push files to that. This is because the .exe is actually bundled within the Ultimate Stream Tool repo, instead of being under the releases tab. Hindsight is 2020, I suppose.
